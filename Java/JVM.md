### jps

```shell
[root@localhost ~]# jps -help
usage: jps [-help]
       jps [-q] [-mlvV] [<hostid>]

Definitions:
    <hostid>:      <hostname>[:<port>]
```



### jmap

```shell
[root@localhost ~]# jmap -help
Usage:
    jmap [option] <pid>
        (to connect to running process)
    jmap [option] <executable <core>
        (to connect to a core file)
    jmap [option] [server_id@]<remote server IP or hostname>
        (to connect to remote debug server)

where <option> is one of:
    <none>               to print same info as Solaris pmap
    -heap                to print java heap summary
    -histo[:live]        to print histogram of java object heap; if the "live"
                         suboption is specified, only count live objects
    -clstats             to print class loader statistics
    -finalizerinfo       to print information on objects awaiting finalization
    -dump:<dump-options> to dump java heap in hprof binary format
                         dump-options:
                           live         dump only live objects; if not specified,
                                        all objects in the heap are dumped.
                           format=b     binary format
                           file=<file>  dump heap to <file>
                         Example: jmap -dump:live,format=b,file=heap.bin <pid>
    -F                   force. Use with -dump:<dump-options> <pid> or -histo
                         to force a heap dump or histogram when <pid> does not
                         respond. The "live" suboption is not supported
                         in this mode.
    -h | -help           to print this help message
    -J<flag>             to pass <flag> directly to the runtime system
```





### jstat

```shel
[root@localhost ~]# jstat -help
Usage: jstat -help|-options
       jstat -<option> [-t] [-h<lines>] <vmid> [<interval> [<count>]]

Definitions:
  <option>      An option reported by the -options option
  <vmid>        Virtual Machine Identifier. A vmid takes the following form:
                     <lvmid>[@<hostname>[:<port>]]
                Where <lvmid> is the local vm identifier for the target
                Java virtual machine, typically a process id; <hostname> is
                the name of the host running the target Java virtual machine;
                and <port> is the port number for the rmiregistry on the
                target host. See the jvmstat documentation for a more complete
                description of the Virtual Machine Identifier.
  <lines>       Number of samples between header lines.
  <interval>    Sampling interval. The following forms are allowed:
                    <n>["ms"|"s"]
                Where <n> is an integer and the suffix specifies the units as 
                milliseconds("ms") or seconds("s"). The default units are "ms".
  <count>       Number of samples to take before terminating.
  -J<flag>      Pass <flag> directly to the runtime system.
```
